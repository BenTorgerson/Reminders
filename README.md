# Reminders

This program allows user to create a local account, and then to create reminders for themselves. Whenever they log in, the user will be greeted with a list of all of the reminders set for them for that day.

Written in Java, and connects to a MySQL database.

Future additions will include better error handling(or just adding error handling in some places!), and improved sorting reminders by time(not always correct).
